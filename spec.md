# Physical AI & Human Robotics - Specification

## Project Title
Physical AI & Human Robotics: From Theory to Practice

## Objective
Create a comprehensive book covering the foundations of Physical AI, digital twin simulation, AI-robot brains, vision-language-action systems, and culminating in an autonomous humanoid implementation.

## Scope
### In Scope
1. Physical AI Foundations — embodiment, sensors, motor control, human–robot interaction
2. Digital Twin Simulation — physics, environments, Gazebo/Unity workflows, sensors (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)
3. AI-Robot Brain — perception, Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, navigation
4. Vision-Language-Action — Whisper voice input, LLM planning, ROS 2 action translation
5. Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid — full pipeline from voice → plan → navigation → object detection → manipulation

### Out of Scope
- Hardware construction guides
- Detailed electronics schematics
- Manufacturing processes
- Commercial licensing specifics

## Target Audience
- Graduate students in robotics/AI
- Researchers and engineers in robotics
- Developers working on embodied AI systems
- Professionals interested in human-robot interaction

## Deliverables
### Primary Deliverables
1. Complete book manuscript with 5 core chapters
2. Accompanying simulation examples and code
3. Documentation website using Docusaurus
4. Test suite validating all concepts
5. Capstone humanoid demonstration

### Secondary Deliverables
1. Instructor resources and exercises
2. Video tutorials for key concepts
3. Community forum guidelines

## Technical Requirements
### Format & Style
