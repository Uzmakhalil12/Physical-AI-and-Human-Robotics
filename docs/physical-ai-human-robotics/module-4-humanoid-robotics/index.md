# Module 4: Humanoid Robotics Implementation (Weeks 11-12)

## Overview
This module focuses on the design, construction, and implementation of humanoid robots. Students will learn about the mechanical design, sensor integration, actuator control, and locomotion strategies required for creating functional humanoid robotic systems. The module combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation of walking, balance, and manipulation capabilities.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Design and build humanoid robot models with proper kinematic structures
- Implement locomotion and balance control algorithms
- Integrate sensors and actuators for humanoid robot operation
- Test and validate humanoid robot capabilities in simulation and real-world scenarios

## Topics Covered

### 1. Humanoid Robot Design Principles
- Anthropomorphic design considerations
- Degrees of freedom and joint configuration
- Center of mass and stability analysis
- Mechanical design and material selection
- Safety considerations for humanoid robots

### 2. Locomotion and Manipulation Systems
- Bipedal walking algorithms and gait generation
- Balance control and stabilization techniques
- Arm and hand manipulation strategies
- Whole-body motion planning
- Dynamic movement control

### 3. Sensor and Actuator Integration
- IMU integration for balance and orientation
- Force/torque sensors for interaction control
- Actuator selection and control (servos, motors)
- Sensor fusion techniques
- Real-time control system design

## Module Tasks

### Task 1: Build Humanoid Models
- Design kinematic structure for humanoid robot
- Create 3D models and CAD designs
- Simulate kinematic behavior
- Validate joint limits and workspace

### Task 2: Implement Locomotion
