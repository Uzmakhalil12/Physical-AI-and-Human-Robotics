# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals (Weeks 3-5)

## Overview
This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware framework that enables communication between different robot software components. Students will learn the core concepts, architecture, and practical implementation of ROS 2 systems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Develop and connect nodes, topics, and services
- Implement basic ROS 2 programs and applications
- Debug and troubleshoot ROS 2 systems

## Topics Covered

### 1. ROS 2 Architecture and Concepts
- Client Library Architecture (RCL)
- DDS (Data Distribution Service) implementations
- Package and workspace management
- Launch system and lifecycle management
- Quality of Service (QoS) settings

### 2. Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Node creation and management
- Publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Service-server communication patterns
- Action-based communication
- Message types and custom message definitions

### 3. Hands-on ROS 2 Programming
- Environment setup and configuration
- Creating first ROS 2 packages
- Implementing publisher and subscriber nodes
- Service client and server implementation
- Using ROS 2 tools (ros2 run, ros2 topic, etc.)

## Module Tasks

### Task 1: Setup ROS 2 Environment
- Install ROS 2 distribution (Humble Hawksbill or latest LTS)
- Configure workspace and environment variables
- Verify installation with basic commands
- Set up development environment with VS Code or preferred IDE

### Task 2: Write and Run First Nodes
- Create a basic publisher node
- Implement a subscriber node
- Establish communication between nodes
- Test message passing with standard message types

### Task 3: Connect Nodes via Topics
- Implement multiple publishers and subscribers
- Use different message types (std_msgs, sensor_msgs)
- Configure QoS settings for different use cases
- Debug and monitor topic communication

## Assessment
Students will complete a practical assignment implementing a simple robot control system using ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services to demonstrate their understanding of core concepts.
