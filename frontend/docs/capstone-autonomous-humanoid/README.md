# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

Welcome to the Capstone chapter on Autonomous Humanoids. This section brings together all previous concepts into a complete system implementing voice-to-plan-to-action pipeline with navigation and manipulation capabilities.

## Topics Covered

- Full Pipeline Integration
- Voice-to-Plan Translation
- Navigation and Object Detection
- Manipulation Systems
- Complete System Testing

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:
- How to integrate all components from previous chapters into a cohesive system
- Best practices for building end-to-end robotic systems
- Techniques for combining voice input with planning and execution
- Methods for testing and validating complex robotic systems
